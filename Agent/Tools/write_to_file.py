    Overwrite a file with `content`.

    Args:

    """
    Replace a block of lines with new content, anchored at a start line.

    Behavior (0-indexed lines):
    - Remove the entire inclusive range [line_number_start, line_number_end].
    - If `content` is provided (non-empty), insert it starting at `line_number_start`.
      This shifts subsequent lines down as needed.
    - If `content` is empty, leave a single blank line at `line_number_start`.

    Notes:
    - This function is designed for replacing code blocks cleanly (e.g., inserting a new
      function while removing the old block with no off-by-one confusion).
    - Parameter `replace_lines` is ignored and kept for backward compatibility.
    - Newlines in `content` are preserved exactly as provided.
    - Quick usage: to replace lines 10-20 with `new_code`, pass
      `line_number_start=10`, `line_number_end=20`, and `content=new_code`.
      Ensure `new_code` ends with a trailing newline if you want a clean block ending.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the target file. Parent directories are created if needed.
        content: Text to insert at `line_number_start` after deleting the block. If empty,
                 a single blank line is kept at `line_number_start`.
        line_number_start: 0-indexed first line of the block to replace (inclusive).
